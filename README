ATutor Course Seats Module
==========================
This module allows ATutor administrators to set enrollment limits on courses. It inserts a Course Seats tab in the admin's Courses submenu where course seats are managed, and when integrate with the Payments Module, insert a Course Seats tab in the intructor's enrollment submenu, where additional course seats can be purchased. 

To add or modify a seat limit, choose the course and enter a integer from 1 to 9999. 

If a course limit is not set, or set to 0 (zero) for a course, no limit is enforced for that course. (default)

The "Not Enrolled" tab in the instructor's enrolment manager is disabled when a seat limit is set for a course. 

The "Import Course List" and "Create Course List" features allow only new students up to the seat limit. 

The Instructor's "Create Course" tab is disabled in My Courses. This means the administrator must create courses. Instructors cannot create courses when the Course Seats module is enabled.

Course Seats Options
====================
When the Payments module is installed, additional options are available to set the price for each additional seat, and to enable/disable the instructor's Create Course tab. If the tab is enabled the default number of seats available for newly created courses can be set.

Issues
======
Adding from the "Not Enrolled" list in the Enrollment Manager not possible currently without core code adjustments, beyond the scope of this version of the module. Redirecting to the disabled.php file works well enough for now.
